## Skill 5 - Deploy to Development Server


We will be doing the deployment in three separate phases so that you can learn
each skill before worrying about the next.

* Deploy a Static Web Server - Skill 4
* Deploy a Development Application Server - Skill 5
* Deploy a Production Application Web Server - Skill 6

To get your app hosted you need to follow this guide carefully.
Move slow to move fast.  Mistakes are easy and will cost you a lot of time.

* Create your code repo
* Create New Application at Digital Ocean
* Configure your app
* App-Level Environment variables
* Create job to deploy code
* Force Rebuild & Deploy
* Test on the Server


### Step 1 - Create New Application

This setup guide assumes you have created an app and pushed it to Github.

* Your code is in the BACS350 repo which is Forked from Mark-Seaman/BACS350 repo at Github
* Sign up on Digital Ocean (sign up a new account for a $100 promo)
* Create new app on App Platform
* Source - Select Github
* Repository - Select your forked "<your-name>/BACS350" repo
* Branch - Select main
* Autodeploy code changes

Create new application

Select Gitrepo and directory

Verify name and type of resource to create

Review the costs (Basic Plan - $5/month)

### Step 2 - Configure your app (use these settings)

* Source Directory: / (no change)
* Type: Web Services (no change)
* Environment Variables: Leave blank
* Build Command: Leave blank
* Run Command:

    gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm mysite.wsgi

* HTTP Port: 8080 (no change)
* HTTP Request Routes: / (no change)

Build Command

    default

Run Command

    python manage.py migrate --no-input
    cd week1/ProfileApp
    gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm config.wsgi


### Step 3 - App-Level Environment variables.

Your App Platform apps will have several components

* Django app (ProfileApp)
* Static web server
* Database

Configure App-Level Environment variables (not Component Variables)

* Go To https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps  
* Select your application

Click Settings and scroll down to "App-Level Environment Variables"

Add the following key/value pairs

    DEBUG = 0
    DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1

Click Save.

* Changing the variables will kick off a build cycle
* This will take 10 minutes

### Step 4 - Add a Static Server

Static web server

Note the cost is free for static websites

### Step 5 - Force Rebuild & Deploy

* Go to https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps
* Select your project "profile-app"
* Actions - Force Rebuild & Deploy
* Wait about 10 minutes
* Open your app and verify!


### Step 6 - Test on the Server

* Visit your website to see if it is working properly
* Test and fix all the issues you find
* Register your URL at "https://shrinking-world.com/bacs350/register"
