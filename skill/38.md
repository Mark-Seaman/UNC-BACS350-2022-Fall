## Skill 38 - Continuous Integration

Throughout the entire project we will build small pieces of functionality and get them fully created,
tested and integrated into the whole.  Before moving on to the next feature the current feature
must be fully developed and deployed.  Using this technique our entire system is ready to go at
any moment.  We never break the system and leave it in a broken state while trying to add new
code.

Incremental development implies that we build the entire system in small steps.  Each step is
integrated with all of the functionality that we already have and the whole thing is tested. 
This implies a continuous process of integration and testing.  The only way that this is possible
is to automate the entire food chain.

Whenever code is pushed to the git repo a test is performed. If the test passes, then code is
built and deployed to the staging server.  It is tested on the server and only gets a green light
is everything is perfect.  If any errors occur, the alarms are triggered and people are notified.

This automation of Code, Test, Deploy, Test is what continuous integration is all about.
Power tools like Jenkins can be set up to trigger all these activities and the notifications
to the responsible parties. Running this gauntlet with every commit greatly increases the 
likelihood of a good release.  Problems are discovered early and solutions are put in
place to ensure that the whole system works well.

Another aspect of doing continuous integration well, is setting up the development machine
environments to match the production server environment.  This guarantees that everything
that is tested reflects the eventual production context.

Doing continuous integration and continuous deployment allows for fast cycle time (measured by
how long it takes for features to reach customers).  When the testing is thorough then the process
can be fully trusted to produce a software release with very little overhead.  But if the 
test coverage is poor then the whole process tends to break down.
