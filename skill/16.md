## Skill 16 - CRUD views

### CRUD Views

Django defines view classes that let you view and modify records in the database.
These views capture the common logic and use the data model to create the
contents of the view automatically.  This saves you from writing a lot of code.

Data Views Design Pattern

* CreateView
* ListView
* DetailView
* UpdateView
* DeleteView


### ListView

### DetailView

### CreateView

### UpdateView

### DeleteView



## Blog Builder

To illustrate how to use the general model views built into Django we will 
create a blogging application.  We will start a new Django application that uses 
a database.  

Multiple data types are  defined along with the views required to edit all of
the data records.  This app  has unique user accounts for authors.  Each author
is able to create books interactively with no access to the underlying server.
Readers are able to access the articles but can't modify the contents.

All of the code for this demo is located in the Github repo at
[Blog Demo](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/BACS350/tree/main/week6).  
Here you will find a greatly simplified implementation of the key concepts.


### Build Project Code

Build the project & start a new Django app

    $ cd week6/BlogBuilder
    $ django-admin startproject config .
    $ python manage.py startapp book

Modify config/settings.py
   
Configure the settings 

    ALLOWED_HOSTS
    INSTALLED_APPS
    TEMPLATES
    STATICFILES_DIRS


### Data Models

We define two models that will be used to create the application.   **Blog** will
define a blog to discuss a unique topic.  **Article** will hold the content
of a specific posting on the blog.

A blog may have many articles so there is a One-to-Many relationships from Blog
to Article.  This is done by using a ForeignKey in the Article class.  This
can be read as "Every Article belongs to a Blog".

blog/models.py 

    class Blog(models.Model):

        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        author = models.CharField(max_length=100, default='Abe Lincoln')
        description = models.TextField()

        def get_absolute_url(self):
            return reverse_lazy('blog_list')


    class Article (models.Model):

        blog = models.ForeignKey(Blog, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        body = models.TextField()

        def get_absolute_url(self):
            return reverse_lazy('article_list')

### Adding Views

When we add a view to a Django app we must create a template, view class, and
URL route for the HTTP requests. For each type of view we will practice by
creating the simplest possible logic for the Template, View, and URL.  Later we
will follow up by extending the logic to create a fully custom implementation.


### Templates

Build a theme template for all pages to use. 

    theme.html

Build templates for Article data CRUD (list, detail, add, edit, delete)

    article_add.html
    article_delete.html
    article_detail.html
    article_edit.html
    article_list.html

Build templates for Article data CRUD (list, detail, add, edit, delete)
    
    blog_add.html
    blog_delete.html
    blog_detail.html
    blog_edit.html
    blog_list.html


### Create Views

blog/views.py

    class BlogListView(ListView):
        template_name = 'blog_list.html'
        model = Blog

    class BlogDetailView(DetailView):
        template_name = 'blog_detail.html'
        model = Blog

    class BlogCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView):
        template_name = "blog_add.html"
        model = Blog
        fields = '__all__'

    class BlogUpdateView(LoginRequiredMixin, UpdateView):
        template_name = "blog_edit.html"
        model = Blog
        fields = '__all__'

    class BlogDeleteView(LoginRequiredMixin, DeleteView):
        model = Blog
        template_name = 'blog_delete.html'
        success_url = reverse_lazy('blog_list')


### Configure URL Routes

config.urls.py

    urlpatterns = [

        # Blog
        path('',                BlogListView.as_view(),    name='blog_list'),
        path('<int:pk>',        BlogDetailView.as_view(),  name='blog_detail'),
        path('add',             BlogCreateView.as_view(),  name='blog_add'),
        path('<int:pk>/',       BlogUpdateView.as_view(),  name='blog_edit'),
        path('<int:pk>/delete', BlogDeleteView.as_view(),  name='blog_delete'),

        # Article
        path('',                 ArticleListView.as_view(),    name='article_list'),
        path('<int:pk>',         ArticleDetailView.as_view(),  name='article_detail'),
        path('add',              ArticleCreateView.as_view(),  name='article_add'),
        path('<int:pk>/',        ArticleUpdateView.as_view(),  name='article_edit'),
        path('<int:pk>/delete',  ArticleDeleteView.as_view(),  name='article_delete'),

    ]


## Running the App

All of the code for this demo is located in the Github repo at
[Blog Demo](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/BACS350/tree/main/week6).  

To run the code do the following steps.

* Start Visual Studio
* Open "week6/BlogBuilder"
* Run menu, Start Debugging
* Browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Visit all views for testing.


## Run the local server

    $ python manage.py migrate
    $ python manage.py createsuperuser
    $ python manage.py runserver

Browse to web page

    http://localhost:8000

Set up static server that is used locally


### Digital Ocean Setup

Prep for App Platform

For App Platform to recognize that your code is a Django application you must 
have the **runtime.txt** and **requirements.txt** defined at the top-of your
source code directory.

runtime.txt

    python-3.10.4

requirements.txt

    Django
    gunicorn
    psycopg2-binary

Deploy with config/app.yaml.  This file has all of the settings you need to
get your application live on the App Platform server at Digital Ocean.
