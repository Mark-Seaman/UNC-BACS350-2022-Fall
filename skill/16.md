## Skill 16 - CRUD views

### CRUD Views

Django defines view classes that let you view and modify records in the database.
These views capture the common logic and use the data model to create the
contents of the view automatically.  This saves you from writing a lot of code.

### Adding Views

When we add a view to a Django app we must create a template, view class, and
URL route for the HTTP requests.
For each type of view we will practice by creating the simplest possible
logic for the     Template, View, and URL.  Later we will follow up by extending
the logic to create a fully custom implementation.

### ListView

The Django ListView class displays a list of objects from the database.


book/views.py
        
    class BookView(RedirectView):
        url = '/book/'

    class BookListView(ListView):
        template_name = 'book_list.html'
        model = Book

    class BookDetailView(DetailView):
        template_name = 'book_detail.html'
        model = Book

    class BookCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView):
        template_name = "book_edit.html"
        model = Book
        fields = ['title', 'author']

    class BookUpdateView(LoginRequiredMixin, UpdateView):
        template_name = "book_edit.html"
        model = Book
        fields = ['title', 'author']

    class BookDeleteView(LoginRequiredMixin, DeleteView):
        model = Book
        template_name = 'book_delete.html'
        success_url = reverse_lazy('book_list')
