## Skill 18 - Database deployment

### New Database From Digital Ocean

App Platform will create and manage databases for you.  This is important to
prevent data being lost during deployment.  Once you set up a database and 
configure your app to use it then all data will be retained within the database
when you redeploy your application code.


### Production Database

You can create either a "MySQL" database or a PostGres.
