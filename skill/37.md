## Skill 37 - Code Generator

### Overview

When you do decide to write software you should always start with a solid
application framework like Django, .Net, Rails, or Node.  As you build applications
you will discover that you keep repeating the same code many times.  

Create a way to take advantage of this sameness by automatically creating the
code with a simple script.  A code generator is a script that writes code for
you when the writing becomes repetitive.   

### Create a Code Generator

Demo 13 is the starting point for 
your personal code generator.  Work through this demo code to understand how
to apply it to your next project.

Create a standard approach to scripting

* Project
* Data
* Views
* Test
* Deployment
* Monitoring

Start small - start simple - start now!  Don't build the glorious thing, just
build a tool for what you need next.  Eventually the tool will grow into something
amazing that will be the cornerstone of your development.
