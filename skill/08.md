##  Skill 8 - View with Images

Follow this recipe to create simple image viewer showing a list of photos.


### Step 1 - Create a new project 

Build the project code in a new directory.  Create the settings configuration in the "config"
directory.  Start a new Django app component module.

    $ mkdir Photos
    $ cd Photos

    $ django-admin startproject config .

    $ python manage.py startapp photos

Create a directory for the static files.  In production you will need to create a static server.
The easiest way to do this on App Platform at Digital Ocean is to define an "index.html" file.
This will confirm that the "static" directory should be converted into a static web server for
our images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

    $ mkdir static
    $ touch static/index.html 

Next we need to customize the **settings.py** file to describe our application.

Configure the app as in Skill 7 to set up **config/settings.py**.


### Step 2 - Create a View

photos/views.py

    from django.views.generic import TemplateView
    
    class PhotosView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'photos.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            return dict(photos=[1, 2, 3])


static/index.html

    <h1>Placeholder file for static server at Digital Ocean</h1>


templates/photos.html

    <h1>Photo Gallery</h1>
   
    {% for photo in photos %}
        <img src="/static/images/chapter-{{ photo }}.jpg" alt="Chapter {{ photo }}">
    {% endfor %}

   
config/urls.py

    from django.urls import path
    from photos.views import PhotosView
    
    urlpatterns = [
        path('', PhotosView.as_view()),
    ]
  


### Step 4 - Test/Commit/Push

Test Locally

    $ python manage.py runserver

Browse to web page at http://localhost:8000

Commit changes to Git

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m 'Create Photos app' 
    $ git push


### Step 5 - Digital Ocean Server
    
Once you have created your initial web app at Digital Ocean you can upload a new 
**app.yaml** file to replace the existing one.  This will change all of the App
Platform settings at once.

Here is a configuration that you can use as a starting point for your deployment.
Be sure and customize this file to point to your source code.

After setting a new **app.yaml** an automatic build and deploy will be done on App Platform.
If it is successful you will have a running server.  If it is not successful then the code will 
be automatically rolled back to the last good version of code that was properly deployed.
This ensures that if you push bad code your customers will see the older version that was working.

## Step 6 - Test Your Server

Browse to web page at the default route of your server.  This will be at a URL that Digital
Ocean assigned to you.  You can also configure a custom URL if you have a registered domain
name to point at your application.

Browse to the web page at the top of your domain.  For example, 

    https://hammerhead-app-i8swz.ondigitalocean.app/

This will load the default URL at your website.  You should always define this URL to do 
something useful for your users.  Additional URLs may point to other pages.

    https://hammerhead-app-i8swz.ondigitalocean.app/hulk
