## Skill 36 - Test Driven-development

### Test-Driven Development

During development setup a consistent workflow that balances different activities.

Create a To Do List that identifies work to be done.  This should show what 
items you expect to work on in the next day.  Every day you should work on 
different aspects of the development.  Many junior developers concentrate 
solely on the Feature of the app and neglect others.

Go for a balanced approach

* Test
* Fix
* Features
* Improve


### TDD Process steps

Test-Driven Development is the most efficient way to code because it prevents
debugging and leaves you with a battery of tests that are executed for years
to come.

During TDD you pick a single small feature to build and test.  All focus is 
tied to the one feature until it is fully complete and tested.  You commit
code after each iteration so it is impossible to break the system.

For each feature, you will create a small test that fails.  Ideally this test
will be two lines of code.  Your initial test must fail to demonstrate that
the test itself is detecting the missing feature.

    do_something()
    check_something()

The next step is to write the minimum code that will get the test to pass.
Ideally this will be a couple lines of code.  When the feature works you now
have the feature and a test to ensure that is continues working.  Commit the 
code and go on to the next feature.


### Development Loop

* Select one feature
    * Setup an automatic test that fails
    * Write code to fix test
    * Commit changes

There are two ways that you can measure TDD effectiveness.  First, measure the
number of loops (features) that you can code in an hour.  With practice you
should be able to do about 60 loops in an hour.  

Another measure of TDD is comparing the lines of test code with the lines of
product code.  If you are doing true TDD the test code will be the same size
as the product code.
