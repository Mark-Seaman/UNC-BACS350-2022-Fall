## Skill 40 - Software Lifecycle

Select four to eight milestones to mark progress on your project.  Make sure
that a similar amount of effort is required to achieve each goal.  This lets
you be confident that the milestones are marking real progress on your project.

Customize your milestones to the needs of the project and the knowledge that
you have gained from previous projects.  In general you can use fewer milestones
with simple projects, but you often need more granularity to accurate track
larger projects.

Keep each milestone plan simple and concise to serve you without getting bogged
down in details.  Shy away from anything that does not make your project more
efficient.  You do not get any extra credit for doing planning beyond what
is needed.


### Sample Milestones

    1. Project Plan Complete
    2. Technology Proven
    3. Core Features Implemented
    4. Functionality Complete
    5. Test Complete
    6. Release
    7. First Upgrade

Each of these milestones should have a label that is clear to both the develops
and the client.  Next you will detail a list of criteria for each milestone.
You want to be explicit and objective about whether the milestone has been
crossed.

Review these milestones with the client or create them with the input of the 
client.  These milestones are critical to both the planning and tracking of
your project.  Make sure to give adequate attention to this.
