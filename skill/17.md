## Skill 17 - Database Migration

### Changing the Data Models

### Update the Database

Create the tables

    $ python manage.py makemigrations
    $ python manage.py migrate

### Make Migrations

### Migrate

### Development Database

### Saved Migrations


### Local Development Database

Create the database

    $ python manage.py migrate

Find any changes needed to the database tables and make the changes.

    $ python manage.py makemigrations
    $ python manage.py migrate


### Save Data From Database

Export the data

    $ python manage.py dumpdata

Send data to file

    $ python manage.py dumpdata > data.json

Apply formatted for readability

    $ python manage.py dumpdata --indent 4 > data.json


### Load Data Into Database

    $ python manage.py loaddata data.json

    Installed 46 object(s) from 1 fixture(s)


### Remote Development Database

App Platform support databases in several ways.  By simply executing a migrate
command a temporary development database will be created for you on each new
deployment.

Sometimes this is good enough for trying out fresh ideas. The big down side
with this is that the database is reset every time you deploy new code to the
server.

If you do not care about the data created on the server but wish to load the
database content from your local server then this may not be a big issue.
You can use **dumpdata** to save a JSON file and then put the JSON file in
the Github repo.  During deployment you can execute a run command that loads
the data into the database. 

Run Command

    python manage.py migrate --no-input
    python manage.py loaddata data.json
    gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm config.wsgi

In **Skill 18 - Database Deployment** we will look at how to prevent data loss
during deployment.
