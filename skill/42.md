### Engineering Log

Create a website for interacting with your client.  Start with a single page
that contains the key objectives for your project.  Let this grow organically
and naturally throughout the project.


Beyond the weekly meeting, this is the most important thing you can do to
ensure healthy customer relationship. Each time you have a weekly meeting create notes on this web page that can be reviewed at any time.

Keep the information concise and terse.  Use hyperlinks to navigate to 
running code and detailed documentation and other websites.  Consider giving
writing access to your client and developers so that everyone can add
to the knowledge that is present.


### Tracking Progress

Scrum is the agile project management process.  It defines a stand-up meeting
where people answer three questions:

1. What did I work on?
2. What will I work on next?
3. What challenges concern me?

These are vital questions that developers should use when interacting with
one another.  These are also questions that your client is interested in.
Consider building these into a status page.


For people that work for me and the work I do for others it is important
to build accountability into the relationship.  Accountability builds 
trust and rapport.  I would like to see accounting for every 1-2 hours of
work.

Example:

In a few bullets you can gain credibility by establishing lightweight 
transparency with the bosses and clients.
There is no reason not to do this and every reason to start immediately.
