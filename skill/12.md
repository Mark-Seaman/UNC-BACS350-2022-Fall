## Skill 12 - Complex Variables in Views

### Where does the logic go?

Django allows you to define logic in any area that make sense to you.

* URLs
* Views
* Templates
* Data

Each of these places have different trade-offs.

**URLs** can be set up to match very specific situations.  URL patterns are a
form of Regular Expressions that are handy for pattern matching.  These can
allow you to pass certain types of information easily.  For example, the
URL route can be used to encode enough data to order and specific part online.
Sometimes it is a good choice to make very sophisticated URL paths that represent
much of the logic within your app.

**Views** are written in Python and are where I build most of my application
logic.  The Python language is easy to read and write and can be refactored
to make is clean and orderly.

**Templates** are written in HTML (with the Django template extensions).  While
this does allow for certain operations to be done in the template this is far
from ideal for general purpose business logic.  I limit the template logic to
HTML with a few extensions (extends, block, include, for, if).

**Data** is defined by the Python model classes.  These are reflected in the
database schema that is used.  I often push a lot of logic into the database
by creating relationships between data records.  


Because I prefer to work in
Python most of my logic is defined either within the views or data models.
You will need to experiment with all of these alternatives to find your personal
preference.  I recommend spending time trying to embody the business rules in
different ways to determine which suits you best.


### From Simple to Complex

The most important mindset throughout development is controlling complexity.
Start simple and only add the complexity that is required. Once a new feature
is working properly spend time trying to simplify it.  Refuse to add features
to the product unless they are absolutely necessary.

As you add code use the metaphor "Crawl, Walk, Run" to start with the simplest
idea that moves in the right direction.  Then you can build on top of that
quickly and easily. Continue to implement feature and simplify as you go.

For example, imagine we wish to create a photo gallery. We could outline the
follow tasks to develop.

1 - View one specific image
1 - View one general image
1 - View a specific list of images
1 - View a list from a directory
1 - View images with other info as list of dictionaries


### Views in Python

When creating new views it is best to start by forming the data that is needed.
This is easiest to do independent of the website.  I typically start with a
function that is simple and can be called for the view data.  Consider this
example:

views.py

    class PhotoListView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'photos.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            return gallery_view_data()

    def gallery_view_data():
        return dict(photos=['/static/images/chapter-1.jpg'])

Test the code by invoking "gallery_view_data()" directly and stepping through
with a debugger.  When that works execute the view along with the template.
Also notice how simple the code is.  Just enough data to feed the template.

    { 
        'photos': ['static/images/chapter-2.jpg']
    }

You can use print statements to show values and get your running without the
views.
Over time this builds in complexity to something far more.  Notice how easy
this is to work with and review.

    { 'photos':
        [
            {
                'caption': None, 
                'file': PosixPath('static/images/chapter-2.jpg'), 
                'id': 0
            },
            {
                'caption': 'Caption for Photo 1',
                'file': PosixPath('static/images/chapter-3.jpg'),
                'id': 1
            },
            {
                'caption': None, 
                'file': PosixPath('static/images/chapter-1.jpg'), 
                'id': 2
            },
        ]
    }
