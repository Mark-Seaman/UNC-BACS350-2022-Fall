## Skill 29 - Media Hosting


## Design Pattern Overview

## Settings

Uploaded images are treated by Django as Media assets.  The settings file
is configured to handle the uploads by setting two variables.  This creates
a specialize static server for dealing with the media storage.   

config/settings.py

    # Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
    # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/static-files/

    # Upload location for images
    MEDIA_URL = 'media/'
    MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "media"

    # Static Files
    STATIC_URL = 'static/'
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / 'static']


## Views

Displaying the images requires using the Photo data model.  For a list of Photos
a template can choose the **image** tag and **title** tag to populate the HTML
"img" element.

templates

    <ul>
        {% for photo in photos %}
            <li>
            <img src="{{ photo.image }}" alt="{{ photo.title }}">
            </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>  


The view enumerates the Photo objects for display and passes them to the template. 

views.py

    class PhotoListView(ListView):
        template_name = 'photo/list.html'
        model = Photo
        context_object_name = 'photos'


When requests are made to view the images they must be served in the same
way as our other static media assets.  This requires us handling the URL routes
for the images in **urls.py**.

The MEDIA_URL is added on to the regular list of URL routes.  This one line
is all that is needed to serve the media assets.

urls.py

    from django.conf import settings
    from django.conf.urls.static import static

    urlpatterns = [

        # Photo
        path('photo/',                 PhotoListView.as_view()),
        path('photo/<int:pk>',         PhotoDetailView.as_view()),
        path('photo/add',              PhotoCreateView.as_view()),
        path('photo/<int:pk>/',        PhotoUpdateView.as_view()),
        path('photo/<int:pk>/delete',  PhotoDeleteView.as_view()),

    ] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
