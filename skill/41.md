## Skill 41 - Planning Grid

### Planning Grid

Each milestone requires a different type of thinking and focus.  In the early phases of a project the main emphasis is placed on gathering the requirements. 
But there are also other areas that must get attention.  For example, this is
the time to select the key technology that will be used and begin working on
prototype tools and code, and test planning.

In fact, each milestone requires all of the development roles to be active.
Imagine a planning grid that contains the milestones as rows and the dev roles
as columns.

This lets you define your milestones and roles for your lifecycle within a 
spreadsheet.  Simply doing this will cause you to think about the progress
on your project in a more holistic way.

Do lightweight planning and update your plans with each milestone.  Track your
progress and measure your rate throughout the project.  Make adjustment early
to stay on track.

### Project Planner

Once you have the planning grid you can implement a single page that lets
you record notes that are tied to each cell in the table.  See Demo 14 for 
the file named, "Project Planner.md".  It is a simple Markdown
file that can be placed with a Github repo to give you an index for your project
plan.

Each cell contains a hyperlink that takes you to a Github file that you will
create as you go.  With this simple technique you may set the standard for 
how to manage projects in your organization.
