##  Skill 7 - Create a Django App

Follow this recipe to create a brand new project with a simple HTML view.


### Step 1 - Create a new project 

Build the project code in a new directory.  Create the settings configuration in the "config"
directory.

    $ mkdir Photos
    $ cd Photos
    $ django-admin startproject config .


Start a new Django app component module.

    $ python manage.py startapp photos


## Step 2 - Custom Settings

Set up static server that is used locally during testing.
Create a directory for the static files.  In production you will need to create a static server.
The easiest way to do this on App Platform at Digital Ocean is to define an "index.html" file.
This will confirm that the "static" directory should be converted into a static web server for
our images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

    $ mkdir static
    $ touch static/index.html 

Next we need to customize the **settings.py** file to describe our application.

config/settings.py

    # Enable data the "photos" app
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'photos',
    ]


    # On Digital Ocean it will use the Static Server
    # Locally you need to enable the static media server (Images, CSS, Javascript)
    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / "static"]


    # Handle all URL requests made to web server no matter what name is used
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']


Examine the Files and App Structure

    .
    ├── config
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── app.yaml
    │   ├── asgi.py
    │   ├── settings.py
    │   ├── urls.py
    │   └── wsgi.py

    │   └── views.py
    ├── manage.py
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── runtime.txt
    └── static
        └── index.html


### Step 3 - Create a Simple View
   
config/urls.py

    from django.urls import path
    from pages.views import ProfileView
    
    urlpatterns = [
        path('', ProfileView.as_view()),
    ]
  

photos/views.py

    from django.views.generic import TemplateView
    
    class ProfileView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'profile.html'


templates/profile.html

    <h1>Profile Page</h1>
    <p>
        This is the profile page.  Wow ... it is beautiful.
    </p>
    <img src="/static/me.jpg" alt="Me">


Take a selfie and save it as **static/me.jpg**.


## Step 4 - Test the Page

Run the server

    $ python manage.py migrate

    $ python manage.py runserver

Browse to web page

    http://localhost:8000


### Step 5 - Commit and Push

Commit changes to Git

    $ git add .
    $ git status
    $ git commit -m 'Create Profile app' 
    $ git status

Get push

    $ git push
    $ git status


### Step 6 - Digital Ocean Server
    
Prep for App Platform by creating files to specify the Python and package versions
to use.
Edit your App Platform config to try out this new code.

runtime.txt

    python-3.10.4

requirements.txt

    Django
    gunicorn

Run Command

    python manage.py migrate --no-input
    gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm config.wsgi
    
Once you have created your initial web app at Digital Ocean you can upload a new 
**app.yaml** file to replace the existing one.  This will change all of the App
Platform settings at once.
 
Go to Digital Ocean App Platform page.  Select App Settings and upload the **app.yaml**
to App Platform.

Wait while it is builds (this may take 10-15 minutes)

Here is a configuration that you can use as a starting point for your deployment.
Be sure and customize this file to point to your source code.

config/app.yaml

    envs:
    - key: DEBUG
      scope: RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME
      value: "True"
    - key: DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
      scope: RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME
      value: "1"
    name: bacs350-demo
    region: nyc
    services:
    - environment_slug: python
      github:
        branch: main
        deploy_on_push: true
        repo: Mark-Seaman/BACS350
      http_port: 8080
      instance_count: 1
      instance_size_slug: basic-xxs
      name: bacs350-demo-app
      routes:
      - path: /
      run_command: |
        python manage.py migrate --no-input
        gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm config.wsgi
      source_dir: Photos
    static_sites:
    - environment_slug: html
      github:
        branch: main
        deploy_on_push: true
        repo: Mark-Seaman/BACS350
      name: bacs350-demo-static
      routes:
      - path: /static
      source_dir: Photos/static

After setting a new **app.yaml** an automatic build and deploy will be done on App Platform.
If it is successful you will have a running server.  If it is not successful then the code will 
be automatically rolled back to the last good version of code that was properly deployed.
This ensures that if you push bad code your customers will see the older version that was working.


## Step 7 - Test Your Server

Browse to web page at the default route of your server.  This will be at a URL that Digital
Ocean assigned to you.  You can also configure a custom URL if you have a registered domain
name to point at your application.

Browse to the web page at the top of your domain.  For example, 

    https://hammerhead-app-i8swz.ondigitalocean.app/

This will load the default URL at your website.  You should always define this URL to do 
something useful for your users.  Additional URLs may point to other pages.

    https://hammerhead-app-i8swz.ondigitalocean.app/hulk
