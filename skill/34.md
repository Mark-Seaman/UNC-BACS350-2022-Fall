### Project Milestones

Every project should be built with clear milestones. This allows everyone to see
the progress being made throughout the entire project.  From the  client's point
of view this is essential to reassure them that you will fulfill the
expectations and commitments.   Nothing is as good as making a plan and showing
weekly that you are right on track.

### Client Review

You should be making measurable progress weekly on your project. Make sure 
that you have a standing meeting weekly to review the progress made in the
last week.  More often is too much overhead in communication.  Less often 
will allow drift in expectations.

During this meeting you will review the plan you made last week and show the
progress with live code.  The customer will give you feedback on what you did
right and what needs to change.  Together you will create a plan for the next
week's work.

Do not go dark on your client or you will regret it. This one simple practice
will guarantee that you stay well aligned with your customer.


### Linear Progress

The main point of defining Milestones in your project is to break the development
into chunks of work that can be objectively measured.  It is important to
define multiple milestones that are roughly equal in cost.

The expected cost of a medium size web app is about 1,000 hours of engineering
effort. You must break this larger projects into smaller deliverables.  If you
don't then you will imagine that progress is going far faster than it actually
is.  

Milestone must have objective and measurable criteria.  This forces reality 
upon the project and builds trust with the client.  The goal of any project
is to complete the work by applying constant effort throughout the project.
Without balanced milestones the work will keep moving toward the end of the
project.


### Change based on feedback

Every week of engineering will increase knowledge about the problems that you
must solve.   Every time you meet with the client you will gain knowledge about
their business needs.   This is a moving target.   So make sure that your 
plans remain flexible enough to adapt to the changing needs.


### Client Meeting

Keep the meeting short but make sure you do these things.

* Review the plan
* Demo the code
* Take feedback
* Update the plan

If a project takes 21 weeks and has 7 milestones then you will have 3 client
weekly meetings for every milestone.  Make sure to discuss the milestone 
progress at each weekly meeting.
