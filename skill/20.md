# Skill 20 - User Login

## Log In

When users log in to the app the credentials are verified to make sure that
the login is permitted.  The browser then remembers the login info until the
browser window is closed or the user logs out.

This means that as the user visits many pages on the site they are only 
required to login once.  It is also possible to implement an automatic logout
after a certain amount of idle time.

To create a login view we must define a template and URL route that binds to 
the view code within Django.  We will start by defining a simple template in
the location that Django will automatically find.

templates/registration/login.html

    <form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}

        {{ form }}

        <button type="submit">Log In</button>
    </form>

config/urls.py

    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import include, path


    urlpatterns = [
        path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
    ]

This is all that is required to get started.

If the user visits http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/ they will see the
login view.


## Log out

If the user visits http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/logout they will be logged
out of the running app and the browser will not be able to provide the login
credentials for any pages that request them.
