## Skill 28 - Photo upload


## Design Pattern Overview


## Data

By adding a ImageField to a data model you can tap into Django's logic for
uploading files to the server.

models.py

    def get_upload(instance, filename):
        return f'images/{filename}'


    class Photo (models.Model):

        author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE, editable=False)
        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        image = models.ImageField(null=True, blank=True, upload_to=get_upload)


## Views

In the form to add or edit the data model, a special mode in enabled for the
image upload to be successful.  Note the encoding of "multipart/form-data" in
the edit form.


templates/add.html

    <form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form }}
        <button type="submit">Save Image</button>
    </form>


Nothing special is required for the view code.

views.py

    class PhotoCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView):
        template_name = "photo/add.html"
        model = Photo
        fields = '__all__'
