# Skill 19 - User Registration


## Sign up

The same template that was used for the login form can be used for the sign up
form.  However it is common to want to add different information to the two 
forms, so I recommend that you keep them separate.

## Template

templates/registration/signup.html

    <form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}

        {{ form }}

        <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
    </form>


## Views

news.views.py

    from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm

    class SignUpView(CreateView):
        form_class = UserCreationForm
        success_url = reverse_lazy('login')
        template_name = 'registration/signup.html'


## URLs

config/urls.py

    from django.urls import include, path
    from django.views.generic import RedirectView

    urlpatterns = [
        path('accounts/signup/', SignUpView.as_view(), name='signup'),
    ]

After a successful registration the user will be redirected to the login page.
