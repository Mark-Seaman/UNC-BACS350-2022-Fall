## Skill 33 - Markdown Documents 

### Overview

Markdown is a simple language to add simple formatting instructions to text.
For sites with a good deal of textual content it is best to avoid writing 
in HTML.  Markdown is mostly text with a few formatting constructs that let
you control a great deal.

Because Markdown is based on text it works very well with version control.
It is human readable and can be easily display as HTML.


### Markdown Format

I recommend greatly restricting the formatting used to make your code easy to
read and understand. Consider these constructs:

    # Main Headline

    ## Sub Headline

    ### Minor Heading

    * Bullet list
    * Second item in list

You can learn Markdown in a few minutes and greatly improve your productivity.
This requires that you master writing, reading, and displaying Markdown 
documents in your application.


### Read Document

Open the matching file and convert the contents from Markdown to HTML.

views.py

    def doc_data(document):
        path = Path(document)
        markdown_text = path.read_text()
        return {'html': markdown(markdown_text)}


Pass in the required document file in the URL.

urls.py

    urlpatterns = [

        path('doc/<str:doc>', DocumentView.as_view()),
    ]


### Display Document


views.py

    class DocumentView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'document.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            return doc_data(self.kwargs.get('doc'))


Display the html text by turing off 'autoescape' in templates/document.html.

    {% autoescape off %}
        {{ html }}
    {% endautoescape %}
