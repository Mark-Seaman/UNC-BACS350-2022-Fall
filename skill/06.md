## Skill 7 - Deploy to Production Server

While setting up a Development Server the focus is on getting something live 
on the internet.  Once we have an initial deployment of our application there
are still many remaining issues that must be solved.

Django provides many advanced features that let you build a production quality
server that is robust and secure.  Digital Ocean gives you access to all of these
security features. We will now work to convert our application code to make
it totally secure and also easy to maintain.

We will be doing the deployment in three separate phases so that you can learn
each skill before worrying about the next.

* Deploy a Static Web Server - Skill 4
* Deploy a Development Application Server - Skill 5
* Deploy a Production Application Web Server - Skill 6

To get your app hosted you need to follow this guide carefully.
Move slow to move fast.  Mistakes are easy and will cost you a lot of time.

* Create your code repo
* Create New Application at Digital Ocean
* Configure your app
* App-Level Environment variables
* Create job to deploy code
* Force Rebuild & Deploy
* Test on the Server
