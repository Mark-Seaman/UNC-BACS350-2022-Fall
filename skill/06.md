## Skill 6 - Deploy to Production Server

While setting up a Development Server the focus is on getting something live 
on the internet.  Once we have an initial deployment of our application there
are still many remaining issues that must be solved.

Django provides many advanced features that let you build a production quality
server that is robust and secure.  Digital Ocean gives you access to all of these
security features. We will now work to convert our application code to make
it totally secure and also easy to maintain.

We will be doing the deployment in three separate phases so that you can learn
each skill before worrying about the next.

* Deploy a Static Web Server - Skill 4
* Deploy a Development Application Server - Skill 5
* Deploy a Production Application Web Server - Skill 6

To get your app hosted you need to follow this guide carefully.
Move slow to move fast.  Mistakes are easy and will cost you a lot of time.

* Create your code repo
* Create New Application at Digital Ocean
* Configure your app
* App-Level Environment variables
* Create job to deploy code
* Force Rebuild & Deploy
* Test on the Server

### Digital Ocean Settings

### App-Level Environment variables.

Your App Platform apps will have several components

* Django app (ProfileApp)
* Static web server
* Database

Configure App-Level Environment variables (not Component Variables)

* Go To https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps  
* Select "profile-app"

Click Settings and scroll down to "App-Level Environment Variables"

Add the following key/value pairs

    DEBUG = 0
    DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1
    
    DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOST = .ondigitalocean.app

    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY = create-a-secure-one (& choose encrypt)
    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL = your@email.com
    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME = yourusername
    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD = create-a-secure-one (& choose encrypt)

    To make secure keys/passwords, consider this post.

Click Save.

* Changing the variables will kick off a build cycle
* This will take 10 minutes

### Step 4 - Add a Static Server

### Step 4 - Pre-deploy Job

In App Platform, we'll do this using a Job Component with your app project.

* Go to https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps
* Select "profile-app"
* Click Settings
* Click + Add Component.
* Click Job
    * Source - Github
    * Repository "<your-name>/BACS350"
    * Branch - main
    * Type Jobs - click "Edit and change When to Run" to "Before every Deploy"

Add Run command:

    python manage.py migrate --noinput
    python manage.py createsuperuser --noinput --email me@here.us

Make sure you have variables set in "settings.py"

    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME
    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD

**Name your job** django migrate

Select the minimum resources to run this job. (mine was Basic with $0.007/hr container size)

Click Launch


### App Settings

Digital Ocean lets you export all of your app settings into a file.

Go to App Platform, Settings tab

Select the App object and find "App Spec".  Click Edit

Click download to get the "bacs350-demo.yaml" file.

Save in "config/app.yaml".

Now you can deploy all changes by modifying this file and uploading it to
Digital Ocean.  This saves you from having to set each setting individually.

Use "Upload File" in the App Spec view.

Try it out with your code.
