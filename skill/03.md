## Skill 3 - Running a Django Application

Before we create our own application we must learn how to run existing Django
Apps.

Test the application code in the repo at
"https://github.com/<your-name>/BACS350/week1/ProfileApp" to verify your 
Django setup. 

Keep 
working on it until it shows the profile page along with the image and stylesheet.  
In the next chapter we'll see 
how to take this app into the wilds of the internet.


### Step 1 - Open the Project

Activate the Virtual Environment

Run Visual Studio Code

Open Folder  "BACS350/week1/ProfileApp" in your Git repo


Run and Debug

Profile App

### Step 2 - Run Development Server in Terminal

Run the web server

    $ python manage.py runserver

    Don't worry about the warning for "unapplied migrations"

Browse to web page

    http://localhost:8000

You should see

Use Ctrl-C to kill the server
