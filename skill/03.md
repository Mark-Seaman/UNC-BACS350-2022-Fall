## Skill 3 - Running a Django Application

Before we create our own application we must learn how to run existing Django
Apps.

Test the application code in the repo at
"https://github.com/<your-name>/BACS350/01/ProfileApp" to verify your 
Django setup. 

Keep 
working on it until it shows the profile page along with the image and stylesheet.  
In the next chapter we'll see 
how to take this app into the wilds of the internet.


### Open the Project

Activate the Virtual Environment

Run Visual Studio Code

Open Folder  "BACS350/01/ProfileApp" in your Git repo


### Run Development Server in Terminal

Run the web server

    $ python manage.py runserver

Don't worry about the warning for "unapplied migrations"

Browse to web page  at   **http://localhost:8000**

You should see the web page for the default URL route.

Use Ctrl-C to kill the server.


### Run Development Server in Visual Studio

To run the code do the following steps.

* Start Visual Studio
* Open "01/ProfileApp"
* Run menu, Start Debugging
* Browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000/

If this does not look like the Profile Page then your tools are not configured
properly.
