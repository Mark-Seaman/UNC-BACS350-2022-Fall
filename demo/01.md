# Demo 1 - Profile App


## Overview

This demo code illustrates the concepts from "**Building Web Apps - Chapter 1**".

As you follow this demo you will need to install several development tools 
on your local computer.  These tools will be used throughout this book to
build, test, and deploy code.

* Visual Studio Code
* Github
* Python
* Django


## Demonstrated Skills

The following Design Patterns are illustrated by this demo

* [Skill 1 - VS Code & Github](https://shrinking-world.com/course/bacs350/skill/1)
* [Skill 2 - Setup Python Environment](https://shrinking-world.com/course/bacs350/skill/2)
* [Skill 3 - Running a Django Application](https://shrinking-world.com/course/bacs350/skill/3)


## Source Code

The code repository for this demo code is at

    https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/BACS350

### Step 1 - Get the Demo Code

Fork the repo for "Mark-Seaman/BACS350"

    https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/BACS350

to create your own copy of the repo with permission to make changes

    https://github.com/**your-name**/BACS350

Clone the repo on your system using Visual Studio


## Step 2 - Profile Page - Static Web Server

This code demo shows the construction of a simple static website.

* Single directory
* Single HTML file "index.html"
* CSS file "style.css"
* Image file "Mark-Seaman.jpg"

To view the web page open the index file by double-clicking to run the 
default browser.


### Files

These files are used to build the static web page.

    ├── Mark-Seaman.jpg
    ├── index.html
    └── style.css

Use a simple static web server whenever you need simple HTML files.  Most
applications require you to implement some sort of business logic in your
server.  If this is the case then you will need to provide a Dynamic Application
Server.


## Step 3 - Profile App - Dynamic Application Server

This code is a simple Django application that shows the same content as the 
Profile Page.  But this app code is more general purpose and is easily extended.

The code helps you test if all the development tools are set up properly.

* Python environment
* Django code libraries
* Visual Studio Code
* Github Repo


### Files

These files are used to build the Django application.

    ├── config
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── settings.py
    │   ├── urls.py
    │   └── wsgi.py
    ├── manage.py
    ├── pages
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── templates
    │   │   └── index.html
    │   └── views.py
    └── static
        ├── Mark-Seaman.jpg
        ├── index.html
        └── style.css

You can see that there are far more files required to bring up a simple web 
application. These files provide a powerful platform that will let you build
applications that will easily scale to thousands of users and advanced
functionality.


### Step 4 - Run Development Server in Terminal

Run the web server

    $ python manage.py runserver

Don't worry about the warning for "unapplied migrations"

Browse to web page  at   **http://localhost:8000**

You should see

![Profile App](img/ProfilePage.png)

Use Ctrl-C to kill the server
