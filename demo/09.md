### Page Theme View

Study this collection of templates that make up the Page Theme View Design 
Pattern.

    views/templates
    ├── _container.html
    ├── _edit.html
    ├── _footer.html
    ├── _header.html
    ├── _navbar.html
    ├── page.html
    └── theme.html


### Simple Views

Simple views provide one level of abstraction.  They wrap some HTML code in
a wrapper that adds some attributes to the page.  These simple views could be
added directly using a small amount of HTML code.  The benefit of using a
design pattern is that the resulting code is more readable and duplication 
is eliminated.

* Page View

* Document View
* Table View

    ├── _cards.html

    ├── _table.html
    ├── card.html
    ├── document.html
    ├── home.html
    ├── page.html
    ├── table.html


### Complex Views

Complex views are built by putting together many simple view constructs. 
When complete these pages may contain over 1000 lines of HTML code.  It is 
very important to create pages using these design patterns. Complex pages that
are built from raw HTML and JavaScript are all but unreadable.

* Accordion View
* Carousel View
* Tabs View
* Super View
