## Overview

This demo will illustrate how to build a simple application that is a live
notebook for user content.  Users are able to register themselves for a new
user account.

Users are able to create content from predefined templates.  The template
contains a number of different pages with textual content.  This content
guides the user through the process of writing detailed information.  Prompts
