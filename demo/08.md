# Demo 8 - Messenger


## Messenger App

This demo code illustrates the concepts from "**Building Web Apps - Chapter 8**".

This application shows how to create data records that are owned by a registered
user.  The messenger app lets users communicate with each other in the system
by posting content.

When the user logs in they can see messages that they have posted as well as
messages that have been posted to them.


## User Stories

1 - Users can register for a new account

2 - Users can see their messages

3 - Users can add a message

4 - Users can set recipient of message

5 - Users can change message
