# Demo 12 - Course Builder

## Course Builder App

This demo code illustrates the concepts from "**Building Web Apps - Chapter 12**".

This simple app lets authors construct a static website automatically from a
collection of files.  The application does not display the website, but builds
a website that can be deployed as a simple static site.

In this demo we will deploy the static site on Digital Ocean App Platform. This
code is an example of using dynamic data to build a static site.
