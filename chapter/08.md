Types of Tests

    System testing
        Interactive system testing
            Use the full system in context
            A human tries all of the application features
            Test script - actions and desired results
            Run system with debugger
            Do not modify production data
            Run testing on development machine

        Automated system testing
            Uses whole system
            Do not modify production data
            May use other computers (eg. Page Testing)

    Unit testing
        Django has built-in support
        Creates and uses a new database for testing
        Test code features in isolation
        View Tests
        Model Tests

    Test-Driven Development
        Process steps
            Select one feature
            Write a test that fails
            Write code to pass the test
            Commit changes
            Repeat with next feature
        Key metrics
            Percent test failures
            Time between tests
            Time of feature loop (commits)
            Percentage of code/tests
            Code coverage
