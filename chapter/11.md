# Chapter 11 - Files and Documents


## Files and Documents

Many applications need to deal with files and documents.  Often the records in
the database are created by importing files from another system.  In this
chapter we will learn how to deal with different types of files.  

The code we have dealt with so far, allows users to create and modify the
records in the database interactively.  But often it is useful to gather data
from files to update the database. 

Exporting data from the database into files
is a great way to get data out of our system.
All of these uses require understanding how to create files from records and
records from files.


## Overview
 
There are many different file formats that are used in modern application but
three formats are so common that we will explore them in detail.

* CSV (Comma Separated Values) - hold spreadsheet data as a table
* JSON (Java Script Object Notation) - serial format for object interchange
* Markdown - document to convert to HTML


## Design Patterns

* Reading and Writing Tables
* Save and Restore Objects
* Markdown Documents 


## Working with Text Files

* diff
* git


## Importing Data

* Files to Records
* CSV - Rows, Columns (Records, Fields)
* JSON - load, dump
* Markdown - read and write
