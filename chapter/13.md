## Overview

Development & Operations

Traditionally separate

Must be combined

Process should match scale

Just enough process


## Design Patterns

* Code Generator
* Continuous Integration
* DevOps


## Concepts

### Software Reuse

Use the lowest cost approach to create the application that is needed to 
meet the business goals.

* Buy a product that exists
* Buy a component that solve certain core problems
* Use a general-purpose framework 
* Build your own framework by refactoring your code
* Recycle pieces of apps you wrote
* Write custom software from scratch


### Refactoring

Design limits new features

Design is unknowable at the start

Refactoring allows design to change after code

Code decays

Refactoring saves

Do not anticipate

Engineer on demand


### Application Frameworks

Solve common problems

Standardize the best solution found

Develop over time (own the improvement)


### Code Generator

Create a standard approach

* Project
* Data
* Views
* Test
* Deployment
* Monitoring


### Continuous Integration

Incremental development

Code, Test, Deploy, Test

Full automation of food chain

Same configuration

Fast cycle time (features - customers)


### DevOps

Development: Code, Test

Operations: Deployment, Scaling, Monitoring

Integrate the workflows

Use appropriate tools

Version control

Configuration management
