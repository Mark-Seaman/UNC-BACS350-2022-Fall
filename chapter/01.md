### Web Servers and Clients

This book will show you how to build web applications which will run on a 
phone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer.  This same app will accommodate
the display size of the device being used.  This layout of all the views will
change to match the device.  This is called responsive web design.

Web apps are the primary way that people interact with servers today.
The devices that users interact with (mobile, laptops, or desktops) are called
clients, while the remote computers are called servers.  This Client/Server 
architecture is fundamental to the internet.

The internet is a gigantic network that allows servers to be accessed from 
anywhere in the world. Commercial routers provide addressing to get to a 
specific machine from a client devices.   A URL (Uniform Resource Locater) is
an address to get to a specific machine page or resource on some machine
on the internet.

A web server is software that runs on a remote computer that responds to a
request for a URL and generates a response which is sent back to the client.
The client makes a request and the server sends a response.  The client software
then displays the response to the user. A web browser is the software that
displays the responses to the user and allows users to make web requests.

### Building Web Apps

Throughout this book you will learn how to build a web application.  There are
two types of web servers on the internet.  Some server simply return files for
the requests that are made.  These files might be HTML, JavaScript, Images, or
other assets types, but they are always static.  We call these static web servers
since that just respond with static information.

Dynamic web servers on the other hand are far more interesting.  They receive
web requests and may do complex calculations and store data in a database.  
For each request the server must create an appropriate response and may need to
invoke other computers in the process.

Static web servers have a use but are quite limited in their capability.  Dynamic
servers allow the programmer to perform any kind of work needed to create the
appropriate response.  To build a web application requires a dynamic server
which executes code to generate the response usually working with a database.

The pages are generated by code written in a general
programming language
such as Python, JavaScript, C#, or Java.


### Common Web App

I've been building web pages and applications since the beginning of the internet
and have written over fifty complete applications.  I have had commercial 
experience with all of the most common languages and frameworks for creating
web apps.  

Years ago, I noticed that most web apps have very common features
to all of the other apps.

* Mobile device app
* Front-end (user experience)
* Business logic
* Database


### Front-end/Back-end 

Web development has gotten surprisingly sophisticated and complex.  When the
browser software began to execute JavaScript code, a lot of software logic 
migrated from the server to the client.  Web pages were no longer simple static
assets that were displayed by the browser.  Now complex code logic was sent 
from the server to be executed in the client browser.

Eventually this took on the name of Front-end development.  Powerful JavaScript
frameworks were increasingly used to create a dynamic user experience that
runs on the client side of the internet.

Back-end Development focuses on the code logic that runs on the server.  This
usually revolves around the database and may include a web service API to
communicate with other computers.  The back-end software is typically built
using a framework that performs all of the common tasks.

Full-stack development involves both the front end and the back end.  Sometimes 
these are separated out into different responsibilities.  A full-stack developer
must be able to operate across the full range of languages and frameworks.

Modern web development is not based on a single tool but rather a stack of 
interdependent tools.  The first decision to be made on a project is what tool
stack to use.


### Tool Stack

For our web development we will be using the following tools.  We will be doing 
back-end development (server side code)

* VS Code - Development Environment
* Django - Web Development Framework
* Python - Programming Language
* MySQL - Database


### Web Frameworks

There are many reasons to use a web framework. It gives us reusable code that
quickly lets you build an app.  This code solves all the common problems.  We
leverage tens-of-thousands of hours of effort.  This let's us write about 
10% of the code needed for our application.


Other Frameworks and Languages

* .Net - C#
* Rails - Ruby
* Laravel - PHP
* Django - Python


### Development Tools

There is a wide variety of great tools available to work with Django applications.
For this class I have selected the best tools which balance ease of learning
with robust power.  This lets you get up and running but also to scale your
efforts as needed.

There are several tools in our development stack starting with low-level and 
moving to higher levels.

* Linux kernel - with WSL on MS Windows OS
* Homebrew - application manager for installing tools
* pyenv - tool to manage Python Virtual Environments
* Django - web application framework
* Git - version control system
* Github - web service to manage Git repositories
* Microsoft Visual Studio Code -  integrated development environment

Each of these tools must be install and set up in order to provide a powerful
platform on which to build our application code.  There are many tools other 
than these which could be used.  But these tools are proven to get you up and
running with the least amount of work.

We will take these tools in three chunks.

* Python Environment
* VS Code
* Github Repo
  

### Python for our Project

All systems ship with some version of Python installed. People are tempted to
use this version but it may lead to disaster.  The pre-installed Python is 
intended to allow users on the system to execute automatic tools but not to 
develop new application code.  Don't use the system version of Python.

We will install a fresh version of Python that is the latest and greatest. 
Then we will install on top of that version all of the needed libraries that
we intend to use.  This version of Python will be totally isolated from all
the other versions of Python and have its own lifecycle.


### Virtual Environments

You may need many different Python environments for different Python packages.
Each environment may use entirely different packages.  
Python provides Virtual Environments to isolate projects from each other.
Over time we may have many virtual environments on the computer but they will
never interfere with each other.

Activating a Virtual Environment means setting up a particular environment to
use from all of the commands that we execute. Each work session starts by
activating the environment.

All work in Python should be done in a virtual environment. This lets you use different
libraries for each project. We will be using a tool "pyenv" to setup and
activate our virtual environment for us.  This will save us some extra work
and prevent errors.



## Skill 1 - Setup Python Environment

### Tools Install

* Linux kernel - with WSL on MS Windows OS
* Homebrew - application manager for installing tools
* pyenv - tool to manage Python Virtual Environments
* Python 3.10 - setup new Python


### Step 1 - Install Linux

The Linux shell is a great environment to execute tools.  We will need to make
sure that we have some kind of Linux-like shell to install all of the other
tools that we need.  Once we have the development tools installed we will 
continue to use this environment to work with files throughout our project.

Each operating system has its own quirks and oddities.  We will standardize
our user experience by getting to the same environment with the same set of
tools, configured the same way.


If you are running Mac OS or Linux then you can go directly to installing
Homebrew.  If you are running MS Windows then you will install WSL (Windows
Subsystem for Linux).

* [Install WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

To install WSL 2 on Windows 10 OS Build 2004 or later you need to open the
command prompt app with Administrator permissions, and enter the following
command:

    wsl.exe --install

As soon as you hit enter, the process automatically gets to work. It enables the
WSL optional features required, fetches the latest WSL Linux kernel version, and
installs Ubuntu as your default distro.  Congratulations - You now are running
Linux inside of Windows.


### Step 2 - Install Homebrew

Homebrew is an application installer to setup development tools created by
Apple.  It runs in a Linux shell and will install all of the other tools we
need.   There are many different ways to install tools.  Homebrew is a proven
way to get a common tool set across all the OS platforms.


[Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Setup shell (copy and paste in shell)

    echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.profile

    eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

[Install Build tools](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux)

    sudo apt-get install build-essential

    brew install gcc

    brew doctor


### Step 3 - Install pyenv

    brew install pyenv


### Step 4 - Install Python 3.10

List the versions of Python installed

    pyenv versions

List the versions of Python available to install

    pyenv install --list

Install Python 3.10

    pyenv install 3.10.3

    pyenv global 3.10.3

Test which Python will be used

    pyenv which python

Add this in ".profile"
    
    echo 'pyenv global 3.10.3' >> ~/.profile

Restart shell

    which python


### Step 5 - Install Django

Install the django libraries into the Virtual Environment

    $ pip install django


### Step 6 - Test Django Install

Create a new Django project

    $ django-admin startproject config .

Run the web server

    $ python manage.py runserver

Browse to web page

    http://localhost:8000
    

### Step 7 - Test Your Tool Setup 

* Keep working until the page loads without errors
* No need to turn in the homework assignment.   Grades will be determined from
the content of your Github repo.



## Skill 2 - VS Code & Github

### Install Visual Studio Code from Microsoft

Go to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Download and install on your machine

Run Visual Studio

Create a Github repository 

**Goal:**
Setup a git repository stored at Github that will be used for all the code you
will write for BACS 350.   All grading will be done by examining the code in this
course repo.

### Github
* Github is the best version control service available
* It is a web service that hosts thousands of users and millions of projects
* By January 2020 - 40 million users, over 100 million repositories


### Git
* Invented by the creator of Linux
* Save every version of every file
* Work individually or with thousands of developers
* Put everything under version control


### Using Github
* All assignments will be completed using Github
* All pages you create will be saved in your Github repo


### Step 1 - Register for a Github account

* Visit [Github.com](https://github.com)
* Select a name that will be your permanent Github user name
* Sign up for a free account at Github
* Login to your account


### Step 2 - Create a Git Repo

* Use the Github website to create code repositories for each project
* Create a git repository for this class

![](img/git-new-repo.png)

* Build a repo named **BACS350**
* Example:  
    * User:  **Mark-Seaman**
    * Github URL: **https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/BACS350**
* Use a .gitignore file for **"Python"**

![](img/git-repo-settings.png)


### Step 3 - Test .gitignore

* Visit your Github repo - mine is 
[https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/BACS350/blob/main/.gitignore](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/BACS350/blob/main/.gitignore)
* Make sure that the file has lots of content to avoid adding Python temp files
to the Git repo.


### Step 4 - Login to Sensei

* Register your name on the [Sensei Web Server](https://shrinking-world.com/course/bacs350/register)
* Fill out the form with you info
* This will let you log into Sensei


### Step 5 - Register Your Github Repo

* Setup your Github repo for Sensei to find your code

![](img/servers.png)


### Step 6 - Clone Your Git Repo

* Run a terminal window
* If you are missing git install it from 
<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Git Downloads</a>
* Clone your Github repo to copy it to your local computer

    $ cd

    $ git clone https://github.com/<your-name>/BACS350.git

* View the files in your computer


### Step 7 - Add Screen Shot of Your Files

* Go to the directory where your Git repo is on your computer (not the Github 
website).
* Do a screen capture of the files
* Commit the image to your code repo as "week1/github_repo.png"
* NOTE: capitalization matters, so use all lower case


### Step 8 - Test Your Git repo

* Go to the [Student Test Page](https://shrinking-world.com/student/bacs350/test)
* Keep working until the page loads without errors
* No need to turn in the homework assignment.   Grades will be determined from
the content of your Github repo.
