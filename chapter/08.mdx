Skill 22 - System Tests

---

Interactive system testing

Use the full system in context

A human tries all of the application features




Automated system testing

Uses whole system

Do not modify production data

May use other computers (eg. Page Testing)

## Skill 23 - Unit Tests


### View Tests

### Model Tests

### TestCase

### SimpleTest Case

### Request

### Test Page Exists

Use "request" to get a web page for the server.  Check that the status code
is "200 - Page Successful".

    def test_page_exists(self):
        response = self.client.get('/book/')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)


### Test URL Route to view

Test the reverse look up from "name" to URL.   'book_list' should map to
'/book/'.  This page should also exist on the server.

    def test_book_list_view(self):
        url = reverse('book_list')
        response = self.client.get(url)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertEqual(url, '/book/')


### Template Used

The TestCase has useful functions for looking at the HTML for a view.  The
page can be examined to make sure that it uses two templates in its construction.

    def test_book_list_view(self):
        response = self.client.get('/book/')
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'book_list.html')
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'book_theme.html')


### Objects in view

The book object list should contain at least three list items.  These can be
checked  with the following code. If no count is given then it will be satisfied
with any items it finds.

    def test_objects_in_view(self):
        response = self.client.get('/book/')
        self.assertContains(response, '<li>', count=3)



### HTML fragments

This code will also find HTML fragements within the pages.

    def test_contains(self):
        self.assertContains(response, '<title>Book List</title>')

Skill 24 - Test-Driven Development

---

    
Process steps

    Select one feature
    Write a test that fails
    Write code to pass the test
    Commit changes
    Repeat with next feature

Key metrics

    Percent test failures
    Time between tests
    Time of feature loop (commits)
    Percentage of code/tests
    Code coverage
