## Overview


## Design Patterns

- Skill 40 - Software Lifecycle
- Skill 41 - Planning Grid
- Skill 42 - Client Website


## Concepts

Incremental Development

Milestones

Linear progress

Dev Roles - Requirements, Design, Code, Test

Refactoring

Change the plan

Use tools



### Software Lifecycle

Dev Roles - Requirements, Design, Code, Test

Not a waterfall

Build for flexibility

Adapt to changing world


### Planning Grid

Lightweight planning - update with each milestone

Track plans for each role

Grid 7 x 4


### Guided Journal

Create website for your client review

Use a template for plans needed

All plans are lightweight

All plans are updated at each milestone

Build a simple app to track your progress

Version control your plans

Gather feedback as you go



### Automated Tests

Development

Monitoring

## Skill 40 - Software Lifecycle

Select four to eight milestones to mark progress on your project.  Make sure
that a similar amount of effort is required to achieve each goal.  This lets
you be confident that the milestones are marking real progress on your project.

### Sample Milestones

    1. Project Plan Complete
    2. Technology Proven
    3. Core Features Implemented
    4. Functionality Complete
    5. Test Complete
    6. Release
    7. First Upgrade

Each of these milestones should have a label that is clear to both the develops
and the client.  Next you will detail a list of criteria for each milestone.
You want to be explicit and objective about whether the milestone has been
crossed.

Review these milestones with the client or create them with the input of the 
client.  These milestones are critical to both the planning and tracking of
your project.  Make sure to give adequate attention to this.

Select the number of milestones

Create a table with four columns

Dev Roles - Requirements, Design, Code, Test

Decide on the key deliverables

Create detail for each deliverable

Track progress throughout project

Decide on how to use the planning grid
