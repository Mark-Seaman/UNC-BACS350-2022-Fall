## Overview

Use a standard process for development

* Gather requirements for the problem to solve
* Design the solution
* Implement the solution
* Test the solution


## Design Patterns

* Requirements
* Coding
* Test-Driven Development


## Concepts

## Skill 34 - Discover Requirements

### Project Milestones

Every project should be built with clear milestones. This allows everyone to see
the progress being made throughout the entire project.  From the  client's point
of view this is essential to reassure them that you will fulfill the
expectations and commitments.   Nothing is as good as making a plan and showing
weekly that you are right on track.

### Client Review

You should be making measurable progress weekly on your project. Make sure 
that you have a standing meeting weekly to review the progress made in the
last week.  More often is too much overhead in communication.  Less often 
will allow drift in expectations.

During this meeting you will review the plan you made last week and show the
progress with live code.  The customer will give you feedback on what you did
right and what needs to change.  Together you will create a plan for the next
week's work.

Do not go dark on your client or you will regret it. This one simple practice
will guarantee that you stay well aligned with your customer.


### Linear Progress

The main point of defining Milestones in your project is to break the development
into chunks of work that can be objectively measured.  It is important to
define multiple milestones that are roughly equal in cost.

The expected cost of a medium size web app is about 1,000 hours of engineering
effort. You must break this larger projects into smaller deliverables.  If you
don't then you will imagine that progress is going far faster than it actually
is.  

Milestone must have objective and measurable criteria.  This forces reality 
upon the project and builds trust with the client.  The goal of any project
is to complete the work by applying constant effort throughout the project.
Without balanced milestones the work will keep moving toward the end of the
project.


### Change based on feedback

Every week of engineering will increase knowledge about the problems that you
must solve.   Every time you meet with the client you will gain knowledge about
their business needs.   This is a moving target.   So make sure that your 
plans remain flexible enough to adapt to the changing needs.


### Client Meeting

Keep the meeting short but make sure you do these things.

* Review the plan
* Demo the code
* Take feedback
* Update the plan

If a project takes 21 weeks and has 7 milestones then you will have 3 client
weekly meetings for every milestone.  Make sure to discuss the milestone 
progress at each weekly meeting.

## Skill 35 - Coding Process

### Step 1 - Define the Project

Write one paragraph that defines the software project.

Expand into one page to add details

Define the Key User Stories

Define milestones in development

Review plan with client and management


### Step 2 - Build Project

Create a high level design

Apps = Data + Views + Test

Create the project

config/settings.py

Configure the settings 

Create the app

Define the data and views

Define the tests


### Step 3 - Build Data

Select one data model to develop

Develop this data with its views and tests

models.py

### Step 4 - Build Views

views.py

templates

urls.py


### Step 5 - Build Tests

data tests

view tests


### Step 7 - Deploy & Test

Deploy

Test

Review with client and management


### Step 8 - Iterate on Data Models

Go back to Step 3 to select the next data model

Complete each model with all of its features before moving on

Measure progress throughout project

## Skill 36 - Test Driven-development

### Test-Driven Development

During development setup a consistent workflow that balances different activities.

Create a To Do List that identifies work to be done.  This should show what 
items you expect to work on in the next day.  Every day you should work on 
different aspects of the development.  Many junior developers concentrate 
solely on the Feature of the app and neglect others.

Go for a balanced approach

* Test
* Fix
* Features
* Improve


### TDD Process steps

Test-Driven Development is the most efficient way to code because it prevents
debugging and leaves you with a battery of tests that are executed for years
to come.

During TDD you pick a single small feature to build and test.  All focus is 
tied to the one feature until it is fully complete and tested.  You commit
code after each iteration so it is impossible to break the system.

For each feature, you will create a small test that fails.  Ideally this test
will be two lines of code.  Your initial test must fail to demonstrate that
the test itself is detecting the missing feature.

    do_something()
    check_something()

The next step is to write the minimum code that will get the test to pass.
Ideally this will be a couple lines of code.  When the feature works you now
have the feature and a test to ensure that is continues working.  Commit the 
code and go on to the next feature.


### Development Loop

* Select one feature
    * Setup an automatic test that fails
    * Write code to fix test
    * Commit changes

There are two ways that you can measure TDD effectiveness.  First, measure the
number of loops (features) that you can code in an hour.  With practice you
should be able to do about 60 loops in an hour.  

Another measure of TDD is comparing the lines of test code with the lines of
product code.  If you are doing true TDD the test code will be the same size
as the product code.
